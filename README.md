# Starship-Lander

### An introduction to the game:
#### Welcome to Starship Lander! In this game, your starship lost control, and it is your job to land it safely in the designated landing dock. Be careful, the game starts when you enter orbit, which means you'll have to take control of your spaceship in a high speed, considering gravity, drag, and some of the physics needed to land a spaceship. 

### Controls:
#### To control your spaceship, use the spacebar to control thrust and the left and right arrow keys to control the ship's angle.

## Good luck on your mission!
